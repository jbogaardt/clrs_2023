WS-3: Introduction to Machine Learning (Monday September 11, 2023)

Workshop description:
This 3.5 hour workshop will provide an introduction to machine learning in Python for Actuaries. The workshop is hands-on and will explore the fitting and tuning of several traditional machine learning models using scikit-learn. We will briefly expand on the scikit-learn workflow as a modeling framework for reserving through the chainladder-python library. Finally, we will kick it up a notch and explore deep learning examples with Tensorflow/Keras.  The workshop will only briefly cover Python basics, so participants with beginner Python knowledge or fluency in another programming language would have an advantage. We will be using Google Colab for hands-on instruction and participants will need a google account to access Colab.  Participants may choose to set up their own environment but no support will be given by the instructors.
 
Learning Objectives: 
1.	Build a working knowledge of how to leverage open source tools to build a machine learning project
2.	Understand how to set up a machine learning problem including dealing with common issues such as overfitting, data leakage and parameter tuning
3.	Be conversant in deep learning architecture and its applicability to insurance.
